               <ul>Secure Medical Data Transmission Over a Hospital Campus Building Using SDN Technology 
	<li style="padding: 20px; font-size: 25px;" >I assumed leadership of my graduation project and allocated the tasks among my team members. Although we encountered several challenges and limitations, we successfully devised effective solutions. This achievement was made possible through our collaborative efforts.</li>
	<li style="padding: 20px; font-size: 25px;">We established a network for the hospital campus buildings and employed Site-to-Site IPsec VPN tunnel technology to encrypt the data exchanged between network devices, thereby ensuring a secure connection. </li>
	<li style="padding: 20px; font-size: 25px;">We also proposed the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology to facilitate secure monitoring, scalability, centralized provisioning, a reduced hardware footprint, and cost savings, highlighting its benefits compared to conventional networking solutions.</li>
